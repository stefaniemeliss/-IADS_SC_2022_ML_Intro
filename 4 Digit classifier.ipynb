To use this, we need to specify the classifier that we want to use and the values of the parameters that we want to test (through a dictionary). Interestingly, the  `GridSeachCV` constructor creates an object that can be used as a predcictor, using its `fit`, `predict`, `score`, ... methods; in other words it is a meta-predictor (i.e. a preditor built from other predictors, an SVM in thisd case) that can be used like any other predictors:"
